# Marcel and Kim

This is the sample app that I am making to test Ruby on Rails so that I can build our wedding website.
I plan on using this to further my Ruby on Rails knowledge into much more.

Once available, our website can be viewed [*HERE*](http://www.marcelandkim.com)

If you would like to test the mailing funciton, please add them mailcatcher gem to your gemset.  Settings in the developmental environment have already been set for mailcatcher.

Once you have the mailcatcher gem installed, once you start the mailcatcher local smtp server, all emails sent from this app will open in the web browser address http://127.0.0.1:1080
